# HOW TO FIND A THERAPIST 
A logistics guide for millenials in 2018. Or at least how I do it.  
Holly Hansen

Hey. I’ve created this guide to help with the logistics of finding a therapist. While I may have no professional psychology experience, I have years of practice maneuvering insurance and resources to find a mental health provider. The task of finding a therapist may seem insurmountable to some, so I truly hope this guide helps you get the ball rolling. This guide is written with the idea of a first timer with insurance in mind, but will likely benefit other life situations.

## IS THERAPY FOR ME?

Therapy is a useful tool for all aspects in life, you don’t need to have a diagnosable mental illness to benefit. Whether you’re just going through a rough patch for too long or treating a disorder, your therapist your best tool. Oftentimes therapy is the 1st, and maybe only, step towards recovery. Therapy is almost always a non-negotiable aspect of treating mental health disorders. It's important to seek therapy when you are facing any emotional experience that is getting in the way of daily life. You cannot rely on your loved ones to give the support only a professional can provide. You yourself are not a professional. Even professionals need professionals.

Therapy is most useful because it teaches you invaluable, lifelong coping mechanisms to help you face any battle. Your therapist can also guide you to other resources available to you. Furthermore, therapy is helpful because having someone outside of your life to talk through your struggles is stabling for anyone. And if it turns out it’s not for you, you can stop!

## TALK TO YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY

Once you’ve decided you want to explore therapy the reality is it costs money. Insurance can be extremely difficult to work with so it’s really best to call your insurance and get and idea of how it works for you. No insurance? I am so, so sorry that truly sucks. There are several therapist out there who work with sliding price scales, regardless of your insurance status.

When talking with your insurance company, regardless of what you’re discussing, always get a name and reference number for every conversation. This will help you navigate possible conflicting information. Takes notes of all answers you get out of this call and any follow up questions.

Be sure to find answers for these questions:

_Is behavioral health covered?_  
Many insurance companies provide limited or no mental health benefits. That’s crap, isn’t it?

_How many visits are covered a year?_  
Those who do may only cover a certain amount of visits a year, or unlimited with proper documentation. Literally why.

_Do I need a pre-authorization?_  
Once you’ve found a provider and feel good about them you may need to ask your insurance for authorization before a consultation. I don’t know why they get any say here but they do.

_What is my behavioral health deductible?_  
Some companies have a separate behavioral health deductible from your main deductible. How would you have known? Now you do.

_What is the copay?_  
Once you’ve met your deductible, if you have one, you need to know how much each visit will cost.

_Do I need a referral?_  
As with many specialities, your PCP can do an evaluation and make referrals. There’s really no reason they wouldn’t.

_How long are the visits that are covered?_  
This one is surprising - hold your therapist to it.

_What are my out of network benefits?_  
You may find an awesome therapist that is not in-network. You’ll need to know these benefits, deductibles, and copays before you do your pros & cons.

Exhausting, right? You’ve really set yourself up for success now, and there won’t be any surprises down the road.

Think about the financial investment you are about to take on. Realistically, how much can you spend on therapy a month? Can you budget it in? While many therapist are flexible with price, you have to be okay with making this commitment. I wish I could say just do it anyway, but that’s not realistic. Remember, you can always stop or speak with your therapist about price any time.


## GETTING STARTED

How am I going to find someone I trust? What if I don’t feel they could help? Think about why you’re searching for a therapist. I know it’s because you feel terrible and you’ve heard this is good relief, but forming those thoughts into sentences will help you get a good idea on what you need in a therapist. It’s okay if you truly don’t know.

- Psychology Today [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us] is a great resource for finding a therapist. They had advanced search feature so you’re more likely you’ll find something you can commit to. Search by insurance, location, and speciality. Sometimes adjusting the filters and exploring options helps you discover what you want and don’t in a therapist.

- Your insurance company may also have a site for finding a provider. Use both websites to get an idea of who is covered by your insurance and crosscheck information.

- Explore the types of therapist and their specialties. There a several types of mental health professionals that offer talk therapy. Find something that works for your location, your concerns, and ideally your insurance. Filter by those who are expecting new patients. Keep in mind professionals often don’t have time to bother with keeping these resources up to date.

- During this whole process some good questions to ask yourself are: Am I concerned about gender? How highly do i value someone who specializes in my concerns? How far am i willing to travel weekly to see a therapist?

- Message several therapists through voicemail and their direct email addresses. A good opening statement is. “I found you on psychology today. I am looking for a therapist to address [your concerns]. I have insurance with [insurance company.] Are you accepting new patients?”  
This step may take a lot of time. Often websites are not up to date on whether they are accepting new patients. Set a goal for yourself to reach out to a certain number of therapists per week. Often times there may be a waiting period before they can accept patients. Don’t get discouraged - keep trying. You deserve this.

- Your first session will be a consultation. Every time you connect with a provider who is open to a consultation, call your insurance to see that they are in fact in network.



## CONSULTATION

A consultation functions as a session to answer all the logistics questions and get a feel about if you are compatible with each other. It can also start as a phone call. Be honest with each provider and stick to the questions you need addressed. Think of a good way to summarize what you would like to address. If you have a specific style of therapy, ask if they are open to it. While this will be one of the most supportive relationships in your life you are about to pay them often. It’s good to ask as many logistics questions upfront.

Some good questions to ask in a consultation - take notes!

- How soon can I be seen?
- What are your specialties? 
- Have you treated someone with my concerns before?
- What is your approach to therapy?
- How frequently can you meet?
- What is your prefered method of communication?
- What is your prefered method of payment?
- What is your appointment cancellation process? What fees are involved?
- Do you have other rules in your practice?
- What is your price? Are you willing to negotiate a price based off my needs?





## CHOOSING YOUR THERAPIST

Reflect on your consultation. Any initial red flags? Most importantly, do you see yourself trusting this person? While your sessions are confidential and protected by HIPPA, you’re going to need to let a lot out. Can you see yourself opening up to them? Can you see yourself showing them the worst side of you? Its okay to not know the answers yet. You can always give them a try and let them know its not working out.

Remember, lying and omitting information to your therapist is doing yourself a disservice. They can only help you the best way they can if you are open and honest with them. You’re paying for this after all!

Its okay to be shy at first. Often time first sessions are awkward. It can take some time to open up and feel comfortable addressing your issues. Be aware that at first, and often throughout treatment, you walk out feeling worse than you did going in. That’s ok - you’ve established grounds for what to work on. You and your therapist are getting to know your issues better.

Soon you will find the monotony of therapy comforting. Often times going to the same place, the same day of the week, at the same time provides stability in your life. You’ll recognize the smell and the look of the carpet, the way you interact with the couch. You’re taking good care of yourself. You’re doing the right thing. You are building a more stable life.

Your therapist will help you make the next steps. They may suggest psychiatry, group therapy, individual work, and many other tools. However, in most situations therapy is always a part of a mental health treatment plan, no matter how big or small.

Remember this is a in-progress project so I’d love your feedback!
