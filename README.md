# HOW TO FIND A THERAPIST 
A logistics guide for millenials in 2018. Or at least how I do it.

Hey. I’ve created this guide to help with the logistics of finding a therapist. While I may have no professional psychology experience, I have years of practice maneuvering insurance and resources to find a mental health provider. The task of finding a therapist may seem insurmountable to some, so I truly hope this guide helps you get the ball rolling. This guide is written with the idea of a first timer with insurance in mind, but will likely benefit other life situations.

## IS THERAPY FOR ME?

Therapy is a useful tool for all aspects in life, you don’t need to have a diagnosable mental illness to benefit. Whether you’re just going through a rough patch for too long or treating a disorder, your therapist your best tool. Oftentimes therapy is the 1st, and maybe only, step towards recovery. Therapy is almost always a non-negotiable aspect of treating mental health disorders. It's important to seek therapy when you are facing any emotional experience that is getting in the way of daily life. You cannot rely on your loved ones to give the support only a professional can provide. You yourself are not a professional. Even professionals need professionals.

Therapy is most useful because it teaches you invaluable, lifelong coping mechanisms to help you face any battle. Your therapist can also guide you to other resources available to you. Furthermore, therapy is helpful because having someone outside of your life to talk through your struggles is stabling for anyone. And if it turns out it’s not for you, you can stop!

## TALK TO YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY

Once you’ve decided you want to explore therapy the reality is it costs money. Insurance can be extremely difficult to work with so it’s really best to call your insurance and get and idea of how it works for you. No insurance? I am so, so sorry that truly sucks. There are several therapist out there who work with sliding price scales, regardless of your insurance status.

When talking with your insurance company, regardless of what you’re discussing, always get a name and reference number for every conversation. This will help you navigate possible conflicting information. Takes notes of all answers you get out of this call and any follow up questions.

Be sure to find answers for these questions:

_Is behavioral health covered?_
Many insurance companies provide limited or no mental health benefits. That’s crap, isn’t it?

_How many visits are covered a year?_
Those who do may only cover a certain amount of visits a year, or unlimited with proper documentation. Literally why.

_Do I need a pre-authorization?_
Once you’ve found a provider and feel good about them you may need to ask your insurance for authorization before a consultation. I don’t know why they get any say here but they do.

_What is my behavioral health deductible?_
Some companies have a separate behavioral health deductible from your main deductible. How would you have known? Now you do.

_What is the copay?_
Once you’ve met your deductible, if you have one, you need to know how much each visit will cost.

_Do I need a referral?_
As with many specialities, your PCP can do an evaluation and make referrals. There’s really no reason they wouldn’t.

_How long are the visits that are covered?_
This one is surprising - hold your therapist to it.

_What are my out of network benefits?_
You may find an awesome therapist that is not in-network. You’ll need to know these benefits, deductibles, and copays before you do your pros & cons.

Exhausting, right? You’ve really set yourself up for success now, and there won’t be any surprises down the road.

Think about the financial investment you are about to take on. Realistically, how much can you spend on therapy a month? Can you budget it in? While many therapist are flexible with price, you have to be okay with making this commitment. I wish I could say just do it anyway, but that’s not realistic. Remember, you can always stop or speak with your therapist about price any time.
